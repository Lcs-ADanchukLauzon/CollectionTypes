 # Introduction
 
 So far, we have used single-instance variables and constants:
 
    var dogName = "Ginny"
 
 Or:
 
    var grade = 72.0
 
 What if you wanted to track all the dogs on campus at LCS?
 
 Or write a program to calculate an average of your grades?
 
 Single-instance variables would be unwieldy:
 
    var grade = 72.0
    var grade2 = 98.3
    var grade3 = 85.3
    let average = (grade + grade2 + grade3) / 3.0
 
 Gross. This is way too manual. There has to be a better way, and there is.
